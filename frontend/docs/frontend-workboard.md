# Frontend Workboard

> Audited 2026-10-09 against the live Inpatient controller and implemented on
> `codex/inpatient-create-command`. Ownership rules remain in
> [`docs/ai/15-frontend-ownership.md`](../../docs/ai/15-frontend-ownership.md).

## Shipped route state

| Context | Routes and workflow | State |
|---|---|---|
| Shared | Responsive role-filtered sidebar, compact header, field/button/table primitives | `DONE` |
| Clinical | Appointment list/detail/create/edit plus legacy arrival/cancel; record lookup/detail/create/edit/diagnosis | `DONE` for always-on controllers |
| Lab | Queue/detail/create plus start, result entry and cancel with live role/status guards | `DONE` |
| Inpatient | Admission list/detail, admission create, and bed list with exact Vietnamese wire names | `IN PROGRESS` command workspace |
| Organization | Department and staff list/detail/create/update; staff transfer; account create/status | `DONE` |
| Patient | List/detail/create/update/delete with immutable identity number | `DONE` |
| Pharmacy | Drug, stock, prescription, dispense/cancel and ADMIN outbox replay workflows | `DONE` |
| Billing | Patient invoice lookup, invoice detail/create/payment and fee breakdown | `DONE` |
| Notification | Patient history, secured detail and ADMIN manual send without exposing recipient PII | `DONE` |
| Report | Daily, monthly and top-medicine reports | `DONE` for always-on controllers |

## Deliberately unavailable

- Clinical check-in, examination start, record completion and admission referral remain hidden
  because `mediflow.features.care-finance-v2` defaults to `false` in Clinical and Docker runtime.
- Inpatient deposit, top-up, settlement and Surgery composition remain blocked on Billing/Surgery
  activation contracts. The read workspace never derives financial clearance in the browser.
- Report operational and Surgery snapshots remain hidden because Report Care/Finance V2 defaults
  to `false`.
- Surgery has no navigation entry while its Gateway route is default-off and its production
  authority handoff is open.
- Refund, notification read-state/retry and other commands absent from live controllers are not
  represented as UI controls.

## Next tasks

1. Continue `FE-INPATIENT-03` with bed assignment as the next bounded transition after reconfirming
   its controller roles, request DTO, status precondition and conflict codes.
2. Extend the shared Vitest harness across each service for role denial, validation, terminal
   states and API error/correlation-ID rendering.
3. Enable and smoke-test the Care/Finance V2 services through Gateway, then expose the already
   specified Clinical and Report command surfaces as one bounded batch.
4. Run an authenticated browser smoke for each role against Docker Compose before release.

Every new UI mutation must still confirm the owner controller, request/response DTO, Gateway
method/role matrix and error codes. Missing producer behavior becomes a handoff, never a guessed
frontend contract.
